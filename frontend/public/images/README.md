# Background Images

## Product Background Image

Place your product background image here as `product-bg.jpg`

### Requirements:
- **Filename:** `product-bg.jpg`
- **Format:** JPG or PNG
- **Recommended size:** 500x500px or similar (will tile/repeat)
- **Style:** Minimal pattern that works well with text overlay

### Current Usage:
- Products page (`/products`)
- Future product detail pages

### How to add:
1. Save your background image as `product-bg.jpg`
2. Place it in this directory: `frontend/public/images/`
3. Refresh your browser to see changes

The background is configured with:
- `background-repeat: repeat` (tiles the image)
- `background-size: auto` (keeps original size)
- Semi-transparent dark overlay for text readability
